undid add token.set("testing");
            context.write(token, one); to map for testing
	    expriment result, testing was being written to output
undid add token.set("testing");
            context.write(token, one); inside of if in map
set to add entire token instead of just prefix

split takes a regex, thats your problem, fixed

plan
load word types into distributed cach, use mapper to create word defintion pairs, use reducer to extract word types for each word.

problem split doesn't include delimenator
try lookahead/behind, doesnt allow '+' switch to '{0,20}' hope long enough
get index out of bounds, change loop
"works" tons of I and A defs {2,20} still a defs

manual init partsOfSpeach
see git for blanks, I went back and realized the mapper is cutting out stuff, playing with TestPad.java to find out why.
